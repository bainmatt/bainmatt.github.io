Hi there! I'm Matt. To the left is a picture of Mount Fuji, captured
during my travels through Japan. Mount Fuji has been the subject of many
significant works of art (Hokusai's [*Thirty-six Views of Mount
Fuji*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-six_Views_of_Mount_Fuji),
for instance). In many ways it is the ideal subject, infinitely patient,
beautiful, static against a constantly fluctuating backdrop of weather
and seasons.

When I'm not admiring nature and art, I am working
with data. In some ways analyzing data is like drawing Mount Fuji. A
data analyst recognizes a subject (structured collection of data points)
behind clouds of interference (noise) and approaches that subject with a
new way of seeing (statistical tools) to extract meaning (insights). An
insight is a nugget of a bigger idea, from which the artist delivers
value in the form of an evocative picture, and the analyst delivers
value through visualizations, reports, recommendations, and statistical
models.

If you can't tell, I have a deep fondness for data, and
in particular for statistics and machine learning, which are the tools
that guide me through the mist toward structure and meaning. I find it
especially thrilling to implement statistical ideas through code and
neat data analyses. I like to write about my favourite projects and
discoveries. You can find some of that [here](posts.html). I also make
music on the side -- you can find that [here](music.html).
