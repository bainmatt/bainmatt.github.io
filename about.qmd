Hi there! I'm Matt. To the left is a picture of Mount Fuji,
captured during my travels through Japan.
Mount Fuji has been the subject of many significant works of art
(Hokusai's [*Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty-six_Views_of_Mount_Fuji), 
for instance).
In many ways it is the ideal subject, infinitely patient, beautiful,
static against a constantly fluctuating backdrop of weather and seasons.
<br><br>
When I'm not admiring nature and art, I am working with data. 
In some ways analyzing data is like drawing Mount Fuji. A data analyst
recognizes a subject (structured collection of data points)
behind clouds of interference (noise)
and approaches that subject with a new way of seeing (statistical tools)
to extract meaning (insights).
An insight is a nugget of a bigger idea, from which the artist
delivers value in the form of an evocative picture,
and the analyst delivers value through
visualizations, reports, recommendations, and statistical models.
<br><br>
If you can't tell, I have a deep fondness for data,
and in particular for statistics and machine learning, which are the tools that
guide me through the mist toward structure and meaning.
I find it especially thrilling to implement statistical ideas through
code and neat data analyses.
I like to write about my favourite projects and discoveries. 
You can find some of that [here](posts.html). 
I also make music on the side -- you can find that [here](music.html).
