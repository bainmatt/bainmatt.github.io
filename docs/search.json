I work with data and have a\ndeep fondness for math and machine learning. I like to write about my\nfavourite projects and discoveries. I’m sharing some of that\nhere and here. I also make\nmusic on the side – you can find that\nhere.\n\n\n\nI am in the process of migrating my work to this site. More\nprojects and reports will be here soon!\n\nExpand site overview\n▼ Resources\n► Machine learning tour\nA high-level tour of the theory and implementation of machine learning\nalgorithms in Python.Featured: Supervised learning in Python (draft)\n► References & docs\nAn assortment of tools for working with data, including syntax\nreference sheets, high-level outlines, and\nchecklists.Featured: Technical reports with R Markdown & Bookdown (draft)\n► Demos\nA short series of demos using a single dataset to illustrate the versatility\nand practical application of a variety of machine learning\nalgorithms.Featured: (In development)\n▼ Analysis\nA place to share my process and findings for analyses and algorithms\nthat have yielded interesting insights.Featured: Do extinction rates reflect changing attitudes toward the\nenvironment?
