Above is a picture of the majestic Mount Fuji.\nI took this picture and am quite fond of it.\nMount Fuji has been the subject of many great works of art\n(e.g., Hokusai’s Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji).\nI find myself thinking about these scenes and images often enough that it seemed\nfitting to associate this picture with my own creative work.\n\nWhen I’m not admiring nature and art, I am working with data.\nI have a deep fondness for math and machine learning,\nand find it thrilling to implement what I learn through code and neat analyses.\nI like to write about my favourite projects and discoveries.\nI’m sharing some of that here and here.\nI also make music on the side – you can find that here.\n\n\n\nI am in the process of migrating my work to this site. More\nprojects and reports will be here soon!\n\nExpand site overview\n▼ Resources\n► Machine learning tour\nA high-level tour of the theory and implementation of machine learning\nalgorithms in Python.Featured: Supervised learning in Python (draft)\n► References & docs\nAn assortment of tools for working with data, including syntax\nreference sheets, high-level outlines, and\nchecklists.Featured: Technical reports with R Markdown & Bookdown (draft)\n► Demos\nA short series of demos using a single dataset to illustrate the versatility\nand practical application of a variety of machine learning\nalgorithms.Featured: (In development)\n▼ Analysis\nA place to share my process and findings for analyses and algorithms\nthat have yielded interesting insights.Featured: Do extinction rates reflect changing attitudes toward the\nenvironment?
